## Architecture & Technologies

This app is developed using Flutter to provide a smooth cross-platform experience. The backend of the app will utilize Firebase for data storage, user authentication, and points management. Firebase Cloud Functions are used to handle periodic tasks like refreshing weekly challenges and managing quizzes.

### Tech Stack:
- **Frontend**: Flutter
- **Backend**: Firebase (Firestore, Firebase Authentication, Cloud Functions)
- **State Management**: Provider or Riverpod
- **UI/UX**: Material Design Components

## Features in Detail

### 1. **Task Flow**
- Each task consists of multiple steps.
- Users can tap "Next" to move to the next step.
- Once all steps are completed, users are rewarded with points or rewards.

### 2. **Rewards System**
- Points are earned for completing tasks, which are tracked and displayed on the userâ€™s profile.
- Additional rewards may be earned by completing quizzes (if implemented).

### 3. **Quizzes**

### 5. **Notifications**
- Users receive a weekly notification when a new task is available, ensuring they stay engaged.

## Key Features

- **Weekly Tasks**: Every week, users receive a new task that helps them learn more about eco-friendly habits and their environmental impact.
